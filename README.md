# Forage_Accenture

This is virtual internship program from Accenture in Forage's website.

In this virtual internship, I have been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz. The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it. That is why there is a need to analyze the data and give reccomendation.

There are 3 main file used to do this project, which are 'Cleaned data.csv', 'Reactions.csv', and 'ReactionTypes.csv'. In the code called Task1, I cleaned the data and extract information needed to help the client. The insights that is gotten from the analysis is summarised in a powerpoint called Task3.
